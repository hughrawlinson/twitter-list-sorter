# Twitter List Sorter

For years on Twitter I followed about 1000 people, which was overwhelming, and
not great for my mental health. Eventually I decided upon the following
approach.

1. Unfollow as many people as reasonably possible (this left me with ~250
   accounts to follow).
2. Mute every account I follow.
3. Group accounts into themed private lists, so that I can check in on specific
   friend groups when I want to, rather than get blasted with whoever happens to
   have tweeted most recently.

I did this using this tool I built, which shows on one page all the twitter
lists I have, all the people I follow, and helped me make sure I wasn't
following anyone who didn't make it into a list, and that I didn't snub any
important accounts who were in a list.

The site is [publicly-available][site], so feel free to use it, though Twitter's
API rate limits are not very high - if it stops working you may wish to deploy
your own copy.

It's written in React/NextJS (I think it was originally a create-react-app on
Glitch), feel free to hack, modify, submit issues and PRs.
